# BrainHeart Connectivity for Intelligent Systems

**Project Status:** Early research and planning

This project looks at how the brain and heart work together and how this connection affects emotions and decision-making. The goal is to use these ideas to create smarter AI and systems that can understand and respond to human feelings better.

## What I’m Working On

- Understanding how the brain and heart interact  
- Exploring how this affects emotions and thinking  
- Thinking about how to apply this in AI and mental health tools

## How I’m Doing It

- Reading research papers and articles  
- Planning to analyze physiological data like heart rate and brain signals  
- Looking into ways to model this connection in computer systems

## Tools I Plan to Use

- Python for analysis and coding  
- Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib  
- Signal processing and machine learning tools (planned)

## Current Status

Right now, this repo has notes and research summaries. I will add code and data as I make progress.
